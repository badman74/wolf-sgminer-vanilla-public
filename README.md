## Introduction

SGMiner, with greatly improved source - simplified as well, as this mines only WhirlpoolX.

## Best settings

Best settings for all relevant AMD cards (i.e. GCN cards) are below:

* Highest worksize possible, 256 on all cards that I know of.
* The xintensity should be set to 4096, but may have more room for fine-tuning around there
* GPU threads should be set to at least 2. I haven't seen a higher value raise hashrate, but you're welcome to try.

## Usage

* You may use vanillacoin or whirlpoolx for the algorithm name, and it's case insensitive.
* Note that the algorithm name and the name of the default CL file used differ.

## Misc

* If you code, you should read the CL file. Really, I spent a lot of time commenting that.

## Contact

First, if you're a coder who read some of this, either the modified C or the CL kernel, go ahead
and contact me; I'd love to hear your comments! If you need help building it, try Bitcointalk's
SGMiner thread - the process will be the same for this fork. If you need help with something else,
only contact me if it's interesting.

You can find me on Bitcointalk, user Wolf0, and IRC - try #Vanillacoin on Freenode. My nick
on IRC will be either Wolf` or Wolf0. (Note, the character at the end of the former nick is
NOT a single quote, but a grave.)
